Lot's of things I would like to change or add looking back on 
the code and I think I have made some weird choices with the 
means I've taken to do certain tasks. 

I wish I had given myself more time to add extra features and
funcitonality as there are definitely a few I have come up 
with that I wish I had been able to implement. 
I also would have liked to have had the time to create a much 
better GUI, but I am to blame with poor time management 
for that as well.

Overall I think the project should cover the main 
funcitonality expected for the system with a 
functional GUI.

Hope you're having a good day ! <3
